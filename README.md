# EEG-classification

This project is using deep learning(DL) to classify EEG data.

The goal is to learn how to combine CNN layers with LSTM layers. 
## Introduction
We used TensorFlow to build DL model.
## The Data
The data are in the format of .mat files. So we load it into python and normalized it; and build dataset for the DL model. 
## Result
We show the result using TF standard method and plot it in python; so you can show accuracy and loss of training and validation set in figures.
